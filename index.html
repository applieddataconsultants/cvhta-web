						<h3>Our Mission:<br />To foster growth, innovation and awareness of the Chippewa Valley's high-tech community.</h3>
						<div class="">
							<p>A group of Chippewa Valley businesses have rallied together to raise awareness and the many opportunities available in the area for students and professionals in the hi-tech field.</p>
							<p>Dubbing themselves the Chippewa Valley High-Tech Alliance (CVHTA), the companies met for the first time in December to discuss how they could work together to form a coalition to market the area to potential employees and recent graduates of both four-year and two-year programs who have computer programming, IT and related skills.</p>
							<p>The idea was born after several business leaders who employ workers with hi-tech skills discussed informally the challenges of attracting and retaining these graduates to the Chippewa Valley. The group decided to form its own coalition to showcase all the opportunities that are available in this region, as well as to display the innovative work performed by their talented employees.</p>
							<p>The initiators of the group include: Cray, JAMF, IDEXX, Intel, Group Health Cooperative, Mason Shoe, Applied Data Consultants, Reality Works, Raistone, and Curt Manufacturing. The businesses offer a broad spectrum of opportunities in many industries – from health care, to manufacturing, to consulting, to software development – and everything in between.</p>
							<p>While all of the businesses are members of various economic development and chamber organizations, as well as connected with higher education institutions, there was not any one group in the Chippewa Valley that was solely dedicated to promoting the area as the high-tech corridor that it is.</p>
							<!--<p>The group’s goal is to grow its numbers and to pull together a marketing strategy that gets the word out about all the opportunities in this area. Their initial thoughts are to gain momentum through social media, meetings with key educators, business and economic development groups, lawmakers, etc.</p> 
							<p>The group would like anyone other businesses who have an expertise in or employ hi-tech workers to join them in their efforts.</p>-->
